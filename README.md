Challenge 5 matplotlib-challenge Submitted by Kaylyn Valdez-Scott Date: 25-SEP-2023 Project Title: Pymaceuticals (Matplotlib) Challenge

Summary Description: In this project, you will see a complete analysis of an animal study provided. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with tumors received treatment with a variety of specified drug regimens. Over 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens.

There are six sections to investigate.

**Preparation of Data** - taking the two csv files provided and merging them in to one dataframe. I then cleaned the dataframe of any duplicate mice, resulting in a clean data set of 248 mice to investigate. Above this section is also the complete analysis of the whole project. 

**Summary Statistics** - Finding the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and sem of the tumour volume for each drug regimen. 

**Bar and Pie Charts** - Used clean data to display the number of mice treated per drug regimen. Also used pie charts to show the gender distribution between the mice. 

**Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots** - Using a boxplot, I found the greatest volume of the tumour per drug regimen to compare whether or not the drug was effective in bringing its size down. Using this method, I found that Capomulin had a high success in shrinking the tumour size, and that there was an outlier in the data under the drug regimen 'Infubinol'. 

**Line and Scatter Plots** - Isolated and examined mouse 1509 of the Capomulin drud regimen to see how the drug affected the size of the tumour. Also investigated the correlation between weight and average tumour size across all specified drug regimens. 

**Correlation and Regression** - Found a positive correlation between weight and average tumour size. When the mouse weight goes up, so does the tumour size. 

By the end, you will be able to read my independent analysis of the data and the success of the drug regimen Capomulin.
